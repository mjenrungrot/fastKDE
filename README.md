# Fast and Accurate Kernel Density Estimation using Nearest Neighbor Data Structures

We introduce fast methods for nonparametric kernel density estimation (KDE), leveraging locality properties and making use of nearest neighbor data structures. Explicit KDE evaluation scales poorly in the number of data points evaluated, becoming intractable for large datasets. We propsed two new algorithms for scaling kernel density estimation to millions of data points. Our first algorithm provides up to 10x speed-up versus explicit KDE computation and our second method is both fast and provides strong error guarantees on approximation accuracy. We show that our methods perform favorably compared to explicit and existing approximation methods.
